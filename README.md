# MMCTypeScriptCourse
Welcome to Modern Web Development! This course is meant to provide an introduction to the technologies used to build modern, enterprise caliber web applications. We will be using NextJS for our frontend framework and Typescript as our programming language. These are the same tools used to build Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Carmen, M1 Finance, and much much more. This course will also cover the basics of Git/Github and how to host your websites for free! This course is highly recommended for anyone interested in Computer Science. Programming experience is not necessary.

This repository will contain all of the code from the lessons each week. You can view each weeks code by going to its respective branch.
